# REFLECTION OF PROJECT
By doing this project I had gained a lot of knowledge on statistic and it enhanced my analytical skills very well. We applied the concepts in probability and statistics course to real-life problems(our project). I had learn how to use R studio to analyse population data and I believe that it will help me a lot in the future. Besides, I am appreciate that I have wonderful members that is helpful and responsible. We manage to finish the project well by working well with each other.
