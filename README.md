# REFLECTION OF PROJECT
In this project, I gained a lot of knowledge in statistics and significantly enhanced my analytical skills. We applied concepts from our probability and statistics course to real-life problems within our project. I learned how to use R Studio to analyze population data, a skill I believe will greatly benefit me in the future. Additionally, I appreciate having wonderful team members who are helpful and responsible. We successfully completed the project by working collaboratively. This experience has been immensely beneficial and will positively impact my future work.
